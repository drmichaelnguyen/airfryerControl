# Airfryer Shared Usage Management Script

## Overview

This project provides a JavaScript-based solution to manage the usage of a shared Airfryer device. The script implements a cooldown mechanism to prevent usage conflicts and displays user-friendly messages indicating device availability.

## Key Features

* **Cooldown Enforcement:** Prevents multiple users from simultaneously activating the Airfryer.
* **Availability Status:** Displays a clear message when the Airfryer is currently in use.
* **Estimated Availability Time:** Calculates and displays when the Airfryer is expected to be available again.
* **Persistent Tracking:** Uses localStorage to maintain cooldown information even across browser sessions.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Include the Script:** Copy the contents of the JavaScript file (`airfryer_management.js` or similar) and include it in your web page using a `<script>` tag.

2. **Add a Button (Optional):** If you want a button to trigger the Airfryer activation, create a button element in your HTML: 
   ```html
   <button id="airfryerButton">Use Airfryer</button>
   ```

3. **Implement Display Logic:** Create the necessary HTML elements to display the "in use" message and estimated availability time.

4. **Customize Cooldown (Optional):** Modify the `AIRFRYER_COOLDOWN` constant in the script to adjust the cooldown period.

## Example

```html
<button id="airfryerButton">Use Airfryer</button>
<div id="airfryerStatus"></div>

<script src="airfryer_management.js"></script> 
```
